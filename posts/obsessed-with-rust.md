# Obsessed with Rust

My main academic interest over the past couple of years has been in the field of
Programming Languages. I am extremely interested in the tools that we use to do
our work as programmers, and in the fundamental theories that underly those
tools. That's why I was very intrigued when I learned about Rust.

Rust is a system's programming language with use cases similar to those for C or
C++. It's completely open source, and was initially designed at Mozilla; they're
using it to build a new engine for their Firefox browser (check
out [servo](https://servo.org/) for details).
